# How to build your Ramses Server (MySQL)

1. Download and unzip the ramses-server_docker-mysql_X.x.x.zip archive from the [releases](https://github.com/RxLaboratory/Ramses-Server/releases).  
    On linux, you may need to adjust permissions to the unzipped folder to make sure Docker has write access in there.

2. Go inside the **docker folder** and use the command `docker compose up`.

3. Go to **localhost:8001/ramses/install/index.php** in your browser.

Done!
